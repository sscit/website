I would like to document and share hiking tours I did in the Bavarian Alps, for the sake of documenting them and inspiring others where to go. Lets start with a short, half-day tour on top of [Schattenberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schattenberg_(Allg%C3%A4uer_Alpen)), which is right next to Oberstorf's famous Nebelhorn.

KML File of the tour: [schattenberg.kml]({{ site.url }}/assets/tours/schattenberg.kml)

It takes approx. 2,5 hours from the ski-jumping hill to the summit cross. The trail is quite narrow and steep, but no tightrope walk.
