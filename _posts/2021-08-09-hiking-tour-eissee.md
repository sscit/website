The [Eissee](https://www.oberstdorf.de/alpininfo/allgaeuer-alpen/berg-tal/gewaesser/eissee.html) is a very small lake on the northern side of _Rauheck_ mountain. I took a bike to ride into _Oytal_, to avoid a long and rather boring walk until _Käseralpe_, before the actual hike starts.

From _Käseralpe_, _Eissee_ can be reached by climbing up to _Seichereck_, to reach the northern side of the _Rauheck_ mountain. Be aware, this path is quite challenging, very steep and lots of vegetation that has to be crossed. Pretty lovely view on top, though, as you can look back into _Oytal_ and the surrounding valleys as well. To reach _Eissee_, the path is going down again after _Seichereck_.

_Seichereck_ also provides an immediate view to _Höfats_ mountain.
