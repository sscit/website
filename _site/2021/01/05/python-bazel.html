    <p>While working on <a href="/2021/01/03/REL.html">REL</a>, I learned a lot about Bazel and its usage as build system in open source projects. In a series of blog posts, I will share these learnings and describe different approaches. Today’s blog post addresses the integration of C++-based Python modules into Bazel and the modelling of dependencies towards the corresponding Python-based tests.</p>

<p>As part of REL’s Python integration, I created a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc_library</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel_py</code> which includes the core REL C++ library and the necessary Python binding (using the ingenious <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11">pybind11</a> framework). If the library is built as dynamic library, the resulting <em>librel_py.so</em> file can directly be imported in every Python script via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> statement. It took me quite some time, though, to model the dependency between a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_test</code> rule and the mentioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc_library</code>. My goal was to add an integration test to Bazel, which uses REL within Python, to read a toy model and test the basic functionality, like accessing all type instances, checking the API etc.</p>

<p>The integration test itself is a simple python script, that imports <em>librel_py.so</em> and interacts with the API. I wrapped it into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_test</code> rule. At the moment, it is not possible, though, to model a dependency (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deps</code>) in Bazel from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_test</code> towards <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc_library</code>, as Bazel only allows dependencies towards rules from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_</code> family. Therefore I tried the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> - attribute, which allows specifying arbitrary dependencies, e.g. to test data. Unfortunately, with this approach, I was not able to specify the correct import paths for the Python runtime. During test execution, Python always complained, that the module that shall be imported cannot be found.</p>

<p>After searching on Stackoverflow and the Bazel bugtracker, I finally figured out the following approach, to get the dependencies right: Apparently it is necessary to define a dummy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_library</code> first, which is modeled as dependency within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_test</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py_library</code> then uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> attribute to point to a <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc_binary</code></strong> rule, which is located in the <strong>same folder</strong> as the two py-rules, and is actually a copy of the original <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc_library</code>. The disadvantage of this solution is definitely, that the Bazel model is partially duplicated. Nevertheless, the obvious advantage, it now works and I can run an integration test via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bazel test</code>, that builds the Python binding library/binary of REL and runs a Python script, to test the functionality.</p>

<p>My solution in Bazel can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/sscit/rel/blob/main/relpy/test/BUILD">https://github.com/sscit/rel/blob/main/relpy/test/BUILD</a></p>
